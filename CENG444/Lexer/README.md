# CENG444: Language Processors - Project 1 - Part 1

## How to build

Run make inside the directory of the homework.

```make```

It will produce an executable named `lexer`.

## How to run

ExecuteÂ `./lexer [input-file-path]` to run the program with a specified input file.

Example: `./lexer test1.txt`

Outputs are going to be written to the 4 different files (sequences.txt, nettests.txt, identifiers.txt, exceptions.txt) in the same directory.
