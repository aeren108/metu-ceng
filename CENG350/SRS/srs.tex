\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of the System}
afetbilgi.com is a website created with the aim of providing information and raising awareness 
about natural disasters in Turkey. It was established in response to the lack of easily accessible 
and reliable information during and after disasters. The website provides real-time updates on 
disasters and their impact, as well as information on how to prepare for and respond to emergencies. 
It also offers a platform for individuals and organizations to share their experiences and knowledge, 
creating a community of support and learning. Overall, the project serves as a valuable 
resource for those seeking to stay informed and prepared in the face of natural disasters in Turkey.

\section{Scope}
The afetbilgi.com website will provide essential information on hospitals, assembly points, shelter 
locations, and pharmacies. Users will be able to access information on hospitals and medical centers 
that are available to help earthquake victims. The website will also provide information on designated 
assembly points where people can gather during an emergency. Users will be able to locate shelters 
and other safe locations where they can go during an emergency. Additionally, the website will provide 
information on pharmacies where people can obtain medication and other essential supplies.
\newline

In addition to essential information, afetbilgi.com will also provide supporting information on 
helping centers. The website will provide information on centers that provide assistance and support 
to earthquake victims. Users who want to support earthquake victims will be able to find resources on
how to donate and support relief efforts.
\newline

To make the information more accessible, afetbilgi.com will support multiple languages, including 
Turkish, Kurdish, Arabic, and English. The website will integrate Google Maps to provide users with 
a visual representation of where essential locations are located. Users will be able to filter 
information based on their location to receive the most relevant results. Additionally, the website 
will provide users with the option to download PDFs of the information for offline usage.
\newline

Overall, AfetBilgi.com is designed to be a well-rounded and useful resource for earthquake victims 
and their communities. The website aims to provide a comprehensive collection of information that is 
easy to access and use, with the ultimate goal of helping people during difficult times.

with social media platforms. PDF Converter API is used to enable users download reliable and up-to-date
information about cities for offline use. Language translation API is used to make website more accessible to 
speakers of other languages.

\subsubsection*{Communication Interfaces}
Provide links for donation and help for individuals/non-governmental organizations. HTTPS protocol 
is used to exchange data with the end-user, including payment and personal information.

\subsubsection*{Memory Constraints}
Since visitors could only have a limited amount of internet connectivity in an emergency, the
website is optimized for quick loading and low bandwidth usage. To ensure that it can be accessible
on low-end devices, the website is built to use the least amount of RAM possible.

\subsubsection*{Operations}
User operations: Search for hospitals, shelter locations, gathering places and pharmacies etc.
View details on pharmacies, hospitals, gathering places, and shelters. Filter the website with one of
the provided languages. Download PDFs

Admin operations: Update the website frequently with the most recent details and information. Create regular
website backups for a server failure.

Overall operations: Maintaining the website often to keep it up-to-date and functional. The website
is optimized for quick loading and low bandwidth usage. Information that is sent by users should
be verified and added to system.

\subsection{Stakeholder Characteristics}
There are two main users of afetbilgi.com which are users and developers.

Users can be grouped into three: Disaster victims, non-governmental organizations and individual helpers. Users are the ones visiting the website for searching information and resources related to natural disasters in Turkey. 

For disaster victims, they can search the closest shelters, food, hospitals, pharmacies and information gathered by the website. They can use the website to create pdf of information related to the cities and visualize the locations they want. The website is easy to use, therefore disaster victims just need the internet connection to click on the website and use it.

For non-governmental organizations, they can find the donation links and they might use the website to coordinate relief efforts. Therefore, they require technical information about the resources available.

For individual helpers, same with the non-governmental organizations, they can find donation links for money, food and blood. They can also help the developers to verify the information and if something is wrong, they can contact them through the link provided. Just like disaster victims, individual helpers just need the internet connection to use the website.

Developers for afetbilgi.com are responsible for creating, maintaining, updating and verifying the data. They gather all the information they can about the cities especially the cities that has been affected by the disaster and categorize them by city. They use some APIs such as Google Maps and PDF Converter to make users’ lives easier. Developers need to have high computer skills, good coding skills and knowledge about creating websites.

\subsection{Limitations}
\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
afetbilgi.com should be considered as a website to provide information and guidance in case of a natural disaster. It should be used to gather reliable information.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
During the peak times for the website, in other words disaster times, website speed and performance might go lower because of the processing and power limitations.

\subsubsection{Interface to other applications}
The system should be able to detect whether the user is connecting through computer or smart phone and create the visual for the page layout and screen size accordingly.

\subsubsection{Parallel operation} 
In afetbilgi.com, multiple processes and algorithms may run concurrently to provide up-to-date information. This might result in delays.

\subsubsection{Audit functions} 
afetbilgi.com does not have any audit functions.

\subsubsection{Control functions}
Control functions are determined by the developers and all of them are reachable for only developers, and it requires necessary privileges.

\subsubsection{High-order language requirements} 
React Native programming language and Typescript is used to create and design afetbilgi.com.

\subsubsection{Signal handshake protocols}
The communication between afetbilgi.com and external sources use secure channels such as HTTPS to ensure data privacy. The website follows established web standards.

\subsubsection{Quality requirements} 
afetbilgi.com is designed to provide up-to-date and reliable information. However, sometimes this might be affected by wrong information provided by people.

\subsubsection{Criticality of the application} 
In case of a disaster, breakdown of the server and wrong information can cause some problems. Therefore, these problems should be solved rapidly.

\subsubsection{Safety and security considerations}
Since the website does not ask for any private data, and only direct the user to other links (donations and other websites), developers only need to verify the links that are provided.

\subsubsection{Physical/mental considerations} 
afetbilgi.com is designed to be used easily by all users.

\subsubsection{Limitations that are sourced from other systems}
There is no such limitation.

\section{Usability Requirements}
Users should have an internet connection to connect to afetbilgi.com.

Users who have even a slight knowledge about technology shall be able to navigate afetbilgi.com efficiently with basic computer or smartphone or any device that can the access for internet.

Users shall be able to get the information they want about recent and ongoing natural disasters on the homepage in a short time.

Whenever a user wants to find specific information about the disaster, he/she shall be able to find it within at most 3 steps.

Afetbilgi.com shall provide the visual of the location asked or provide the pdf file that is asked.

\section{Performance Requirements}
The system shall be able to handle many users at the same time especially at a disaster time.

All pages and links provided shall be loaded within 3 seconds after a user clicks on them.

Afetbilgi.com shall retrieve the results for any given query in less than 3 seconds.

System shall be able to provide the visual of the location chosen from Google Maps and provide the pdf file that is asked according to the city within 5 seconds at most.

The response time of the database for any operation shall not exceed 10 seconds.

\section{Logical Database Requirements}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{db1}
    \centering
    \caption{Logical Database Diagram}
\end{figure}

The proposed database structure for the emergency information stored on the website involves using separate Google Sheets files to represent tables or collections within the database. Each Google Sheets file would correspond to a separate table/collection in the database, with each row in the file representing a separate record in the table/collection.

The columns in the Google Sheets file would represent the different fields associated with each record, such as the name of the location, its address, phone number, and type of emergency resource it offers. To ensure that the information presented on the website is up-to-date and accurate, the tables/collections would be periodically parsed at specific time intervals.

The parsing process would involve extracting the data from the Google Sheets files, checking for any updates or changes, and then updating the corresponding records in the database accordingly. This approach would provide a simple and efficient way to manage the emergency information stored on the website, as well as enable easy updates to be made by authorized personnel.

The database would be designed to handle a large amount of data, with appropriate indexing and optimization techniques employed to ensure fast and efficient data retrieval. The database would also be secure, with appropriate access controls and permissions put in place to restrict unauthorized access to the data. Finally, the database would be scalable, allowing for additional emergency information to be easily added in the future as needed
